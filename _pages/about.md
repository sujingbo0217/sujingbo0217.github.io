Greetings! I am Jingbo Su (Bob), a senior year college student major in Computer Science and Technology at the [North China University of Technology](http://www.ncut.edu.cn), Beijing, China. At present, I an participating in the [Graduate Preparation Program - Engineering](https://gpp.ucr.edu/engineering) at the [University of California, Riverside](https://www.ucr.edu) to complete my last undergraduate year.

## On-Going Research

<!-- ### Neural Architecture Search with Evolutionary Algorithms for Natural Language Processing

Currently, I am conducting research on Neural Architecture Search (NAS), as my senior design with my mentors â€” [Ruobin Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oFAHM8QAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra) and [Lin Xu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-PEahpMAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra). First developed by Google in 2017, NAS has gained popularity as many methods proposed in subsequent years save computational costs and allowed for the search of more efficient neural network architectures. However, I believe that the limitations of complex search strategies and restricted applications in research areas should be taken into consideration today. To address the first constraint, evolutionary algorithms are proposed. I have published a [conference paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/370983446_A_Parallel_Gannet_Optimization_Algorithm_with_Communication_Strategies_PGOA) about novel evolutionary algorithms, which not only offer simplicity in conception and execution, but also have many advantages such as efficient avoidance of local optima and boost the convergence speed; Secondly, it was noted that researchers prioritize benchmarking their models and pursue the SOTA on computer vision datasets like the CIFAR-10. Hence, it may be beneficial to develop novel benchmarking methods for NLP or LLMs, enabling one to fine-tune their models through adapter type and position variation, with subsequent evaluation of architecture performance. -->

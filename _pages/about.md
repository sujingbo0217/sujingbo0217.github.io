Greetings! I am Jingbo Su (Bob), a senior year college student major in Computer Science and Technology at the [North China University of Technology](http://www.ncut.edu.cn), Beijing, China. At present, I an participating in the [Graduate Preparation Program - Engineering](https://gpp.ucr.edu/engineering) at the [University of California, Riverside](https://www.ucr.edu) to complete my last undergraduate year.

## On-Going Projects

### Neural Architecture Search with Evolutionary Algorithms for Natural Language Processing

To be continued...

<!-- Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has been developed since the 2017. At first, it was hard for researchers to solve NAS problem because of its tremendous computational cost. However, after the [research] from 2018, which dramatically reduce the computational cost of search process, NAS became more and more popular. So far, not only a host of search spaces have been defined, but also a great number of search strategies have been designed. However, in research field, most of researchers would like to design their models with complex strategies and test on computer vision datasets. With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), tuning the LLMs for better performance on the specific field as a professor is becoming a goal to improve human's life. Therefore, I would like to use the simple Evolutionary Algorithms (EA) as the search strategy and pay attention to the Natural Language Processing (NLP) such as finetine and deploy the LLMs more efficiently. -->
